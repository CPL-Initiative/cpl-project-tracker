# Program requirements harvest lessons — archive 4

Sections moved verbatim from `docs/program_requirements_harvest_lessons.md` to keep it under its budget.

## Moved from the lane (S419 compaction)

**Crafton Hills and Taft (S412-S413)** read by the SmartCatalog walk (index, then a subject or group page, then the program page): Crafton 76 of 79 found and loaded, 51 passing the machine checks, Japanese unfound; Taft 58 of 63, 24 passing (most arithmetic failures read the page's 60-unit degree total as the major's). **Merced (S414):** 154 of 172 found, 153 loaded, 125 passing ($9.14). **The slash rescoring (S414)** replaced Glendale's 14, De Anza's 12, Los Angeles Trade Technical's 5 and Crafton Hills' 2 by free reconcile runs. **A printed degree floor (S415):** Delta's steps read "Minimum Degree Units Required: 60" as `degree_total_minimum`, and the scorer lets a floor alone make up a short sum (152 to 154 passing, 71 reread); Taft's step sets a transfer degree's Cal-GETC to the statewide 34 (24 to 34 passing, 17 reread; Fable's option A; kept: Sam's Open Asks Sheet 94 card 4, 13:43Z).

**The registry** (`kb/supabase_program_source_registry.sql`, applied live
2026-10-03 as four migrations):
- `program_source_registry`: one row per college in `coci_college_programs`
 (118: 115 with credit programs, the two continuing-education colleges,
 Calbright), keyed by the catalog-data college name, seeded with an https
 homepage from the CEO list. Calbright College Credit has no `map_colleges` id.
 Columns follow the plan's registry table: catalog URL and year, platform,
 format, CMS public view, sequence source and URL, best method, access status
 and notes, trust evidence (Phase 1), the census's evidence and run id, and
 `corrected_by` / `corrected_at` / `correction_note` for a person.
- `program_source_registry_history`: a trigger files every prior row on UPDATE
 or DELETE, naming the census run or the person. A run rolls back from it.
- `program_source_census_apply(run_id, rows)`: the census's only write. A row
 with `corrected_by` set keeps its values; the census files its reading in
 `census_evidence.census_values` and sets `census_disagrees`. Service role
 only. anon and authenticated hold SELECT on the registry and nothing else
 on either table.

**Sam's rulings (2026-10-03):** build our own best version now; the Butte
College Tech Center's COCI ROE fields are a parallel track, never a gate
(*"working on that end is often a slog or dead end"*); start from use cases and
test against real catalog pages; a per-college source registry kept current by
agents; a per-college tab; an agent per college that the college and the MAP
team own and train. S320: "Go" on the registry table as described (its
history, its one write path, a public read); "Approved" on the push that adds
the weekly apply.
