# Branch policy — the full record

- Work on feature branches; open a PR to `main`.
- Claude sessions: use `claude/<short-description>` branches (the session
  harness handles this automatically). **Sibling branches authorized (Sam,
  2026-06-11):** a session may create additional `claude/<desc>` branches
  off `main` for INDEPENDENT PRs, instead of serializing unrelated changes
  through one branch (the Session-41 friction: 3 stacked PRs, each needing
  a post-squash rebuild). One concern per branch; the assigned branch stays
  the default for the session's main workstream.
- **Artifact policy (added Session 41, 2026-06-11):** prefer CODE-ONLY PRs —
  ship generator/consumer changes without committing the regenerated
  `unified_courses_*.js` / `credential_reference_data.js` artifacts, and let
  the daily cron (or a `workflow_dispatch`) publish them. Committing ~100MB
  of artifacts from a session is what made #348 conflict with the mid-PR
  backstop cron (generated-file conflicts are never resolvable by picking
  sides — you rebuild + regen). Manual live-on-merge artifact commits remain
  the FALLBACK when same-hour liveness matters and no dispatch path exists.
  ✅ **Dispatch GRANTED + CONFIRMED 2026-06-11** (Sam accepted the Claude
  GitHub App's Actions permission; a session dispatched `daily-dashboard.yml`
  via `mcp__github__actions_run_trigger` the same minute — 204). The
  post-merge dispatch is now the DEFAULT: merge the code-only PR, dispatch
  the workflow, let the runner publish artifacts. Manual artifact commits
  only when the workflow itself is broken.
- **Sam's one-time repo toggles — ALL SET 2026-06-11:** ① **Allow
  auto-merge** ✅ (a session can `enable_pr_auto_merge` after marking ready);
  ② **Automatically delete head branches** ✅ (the post-merge 403 branch
  leftovers end); ③ Claude GitHub App **Actions: Read and write** ✅
  (self-dispatch works — cron self-heal + the artifact policy above are
  live).
- **Always watch PRs.** When a Claude session opens a PR, subscribe to its
  activity (CI + review comments) and follow through — fixing small/clear
  issues, asking when ambiguous — until the PR is merged or closed.
- **Auto-merge authorization (added Session 11, 2026-05-27; broadened
  Session 12, 2026-05-27 — Bruh Dec; trust-expanded 2026-05-30 — Sam:
  "change rules to not require my review before you squash-merge. I trust
  you at this point, Bruh!").** Claude sessions merge **every** PR they
  open in this project as soon as the universal gates below are met.
  **Sam's review/approval is NOT a gate — do not wait for him to review,
  and do not wait for an explicit "merge" go-ahead.** Open the PR (as a
  draft per the harness default), let CI run, then mark it ready and
  squash-merge the moment CI is green. The "confirm-before-merging for
  architecturally significant PRs" carve-out was removed: the real safety
  mechanisms for re-mints / schema migrations / Excel→Supabase phases are
  inside the workstream itself (pre-merge dry-run review, in-script V1–V4
  apply gates, `workflow_dispatch` manual triggers on the apply workflow),
  not at the PR-merge button. Merging an apply-script PR doesn't auto-run
  the apply.
  - **CI gate = required checks pass; merge on `clean` OR `unstable`.** "Green"
    means the *required* check(s) (TruffleHog, plus any push-only checks like
    CodeQL when they apply) passed. In GitHub's `mergeable_state`, that is **both
    `clean`** (everything green) **and `unstable`** (mergeable; only a
    *non-required* check is still pending/failing — a pending/failing *required*
    check reads **`blocked`**, never `unstable`). **So merge on `unstable` too —
    do NOT wait for it to flip to `clean`.** Only **`blocked`** (required check
    failing/pending), **`dirty`** (merge conflict), or **`behind`** actually gate.
    (Over-waiting for `clean` on `unstable` PRs — then ending the turn so the
    CI-success event never woke the session — is what made #221/#223 sit until
    Sam nudged "Go!", 2026-06-01. Don't.)
  - **Poll CI via the MCP `github` tools, NOT `curl` (Session 76).** The remote
    sandbox's `GH_TOKEN`/`curl` against `api.github.com` returns *"GitHub access
    is not enabled for this session"* — only the **MCP `github` server** can reach
    GitHub. So a `Monitor`/Bash loop that curls the check-runs API to watch CI
    **silently times out** (it never gets data). Check status with
    `pull_request_read {method:"get"}` (small — read `mergeable_state`) or
    `actions_list {method:"list_workflow_runs"}` (large — parse the saved
    tool-result file with python, don't read it inline). Webhooks don't deliver
    CI *success*, so you must poll. ⚠️ **A `check_suite.completed` wake is NOT a green light** —
    it names a `head_sha`, and on this repo it is routinely a SUPERSEDED one (Session 187 hit
    this twice; Sky188 got four in a row, the last of which reported a suite the session had
    just CANCELED as "completed"). Always re-read `get_check_runs` on the CURRENT head before
    acting.
  - **Autonomous engineering PRs → merge on green; don't wait for a comment,
    review, or "Go!".** For the session's *own* work (refactors, migrations, bug
    fixes, dead-code deletes, generator/doc changes it initiated), Sam's
    review/comment is **not a gate** — he trusts the session to merge. If a
    reviewer comment **already exists** and is an unresolved change-request,
    address it (fix, or ask when ambiguous) first; absent that, a
    mergeable-on-green PR is squash-merged, full stop. (#221/#223 should have
    merged on `unstable` instead of ending the turn to wait for Sam's "Go!" —
    2026-06-01.)
  - **Carve-out — hold for input ONLY when you have a concrete reason to.** The
    default is always merge-on-green (above), **including for docs Sam
    commissioned** — being a thing he asked for is **not** itself a reason to hold.
    Hold (ready, not draft) only when there's a specific, articulable reason the
    merge genuinely benefits from his input first: the deliverable has a known
    **gap** pending something only he supplies (a screenshot to finish a section),
    or an embedded **decision** only he can make. That concrete reason is what made
    the #222 hold right — §5 had an explicit placeholder for his screenshot. (Sam,
    2026-06-01: *"Good call on holding 222"* + *"hold for comment only if you have
    a reason to hold."*) **No reason → merge**, even if he asked for it; fold later
    polish into a follow-up. When you DO hold: mark **ready**, state the reason,
    merge on his nod. Never leave it in *draft*.
  - **Merge promptly — never PARK a PR in DRAFT.** Mark it **ready immediately** (a
    PR can be ready while CI runs). For autonomous work, squash-merge the instant
    it's mergeable on green (`clean` OR `unstable`) — in the SAME turn, rather than
    ending the turn to "wait." Draft-parking is the sin (#202 left in draft during
    recon, 2026-05-30); a *ready* PR held briefly for Sam's input on a deliverable
    he commissioned is fine (#222).
  - **Backstop — auto-merge is ENABLED (Sam's toggle ①, 2026-06-11):** after
    marking ready, call `mcp__github__enable_pr_auto_merge` (squash) and GitHub
    merges the instant required checks pass — no turn-ending wait, no nudge
    needed. Note it refuses while a required check is still in-progress; poll
    checks via the MCP github tools and retry, or squash-merge manually per the
    rules above.
  - **Method: squash and merge** — collapses to one commit on `main` with
    the PR title + body. Matches the existing `Merge pull request #N`
    history pattern.
  - **Feature branches auto-delete on merge** (Sam's toggle ②, 2026-06-11).
    Don't run `git push origin --delete` from a session — the session token
    403s on branch deletes; GitHub's auto-delete handles it.
  - **Never force-push `main`** (Rule 5 — Pages serves from it).
  - Use `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` with `merge_method: "squash"`.
  - The session-end handoff still notes any architecturally-significant
    PR that landed so the next session has context, even though no
    pre-merge pause happened.
