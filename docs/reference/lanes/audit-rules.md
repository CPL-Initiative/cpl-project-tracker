# Row-auditor rules (phase 1c)

> **Relocated verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` §11 on 2026-08-28** (Session 206, the
> consolidation). This is **always-current lane state, not an archive** —
> update it at every checkpoint that lands or retires an audit rule.

**What this lane is:** more audit rules in `kb/_row_audit.py` — the dual-score
auditor that grades every identity row.

## Status — in progress

More audit rules — **9 of 10 landed:** `discipline_title_mismatch`, `generic_title_concrete_discipline`, `top_discipline_disagreement` (+ SISTER_PAIRS suppression), `description_discipline_disagreement`, `subject_collision_signal` (Phase 1e diagnostic — **7,203 flags pre-re-mint**, target 0 post-re-mint), `unit_anomaly` (2026-05-26, 4,385 flags — first member-level cross-validation, also first non-discipline penalty via `TAG_PENALTY_ON_UNITS`; surfaces possible over-merges across credit-vs-noncredit unit-load variants), and **`merge_into_orphan`** (2026-05-27, **0 flags on current data** — preventive data-integrity detector for dangling `merge_into` pointers; valid targets = courses ∪ singletons ∪ `UC-CUR-*`; fires symmetrically on M-IDs + clusters with bad curation pointers). **`member_top_divergence`** (2026-05-29, **1,299 flags** — the cross-discipline over-merge detector; member colleges' TOP codes span ≥2 broad divisions, ≥30% minority; 736 carry no other strong signal; second member-level rule after `unit_anomaly`). **`subject_discipline_outlier`** (2026-07-13, Session 113, #761 — **~302 flags**, penalty 0.20; the mis-mint detector Sam's HVAC M10FR catch motivated: a row's assigned discipline is a small minority (≤15%, ≤3 rows) of its LOCAL SUBJECT CODE cohort AND the TOP code OR curated lexicon corroborates the SAME correction — two-signals-agree; **covers singletons** the corroboration-gated `top_discipline_disagreement` skips; 41 corrections fired `mismint-s113@bot`, `kb/mismint_out/2026-07-13/`; carries a `suggested_fix`). **Still queued:** `cluster_title_drift` (low yield until more clusters mint)
