# Common CR Reference

> **Relocated verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` §11 on 2026-08-28** (Session 206, the

**What this lane is:** A canonical vocabulary of credit recommendations — what the CER did for freehand credential titles, for the freehand recommendation text.

## Status

✅ **WORKLIST LIVE** (scoped SkyRunner #1174; built SkyCall #1176). ⭐ **SAM'S DESIGN RULING:** *"CID is only one factor… similar to the CCR, we take into account matching factors like title, course name and number, course description, subject, etc."* — illustrative, not exhaustive. C-ID-as-key fails BOTH ways: it over-merges (`AJ 110` on two genuinely different POST lines) and under-merges badly (only ~17% of the 2,344 strings carry a C-ID at all). ⭐ **AUTOMATION REACHES ~10%, SO THIS IS A CURATION WORKBENCH, NOT A MERGE ENGINE** — rung 1 published statewide 351 lines/134 credentials · rung 2 C-ID 36 of those · rung 3 CCR course identity 40 strings · rung 4 mechanical twin ~160 · rung 5 similarity **suggests, never merges**. **~90% is curator judgment no matcher reaches** (*Racial Issues and the Police* ≡ *Community Relations* — one POST topic, unrelated words), which is what the **+ Add a wording** picker is for. ⭐ **SCOPE IS GLOBAL + a split affordance (Sam, 2026-08-13):** 407 strings (17%) span >1 credential but carry **45% of all articulation rows**, and `Introduction to FCAW` is one recommendation under all ten AWS/ASME credentials carrying it. ⚠️ **RANK BY COLLAPSE VALUE (wordings × colleges), NEVER BY CREDENTIALS SPANNED** — the widest-spreading string is `3 hours in Elective Course Credits`: 61 credentials, **1 college**, a placeholder. Credentials-spanned would have ranked the corpus's least useful string #1; collapse value sinks it to #174 with no special case. Real head: `Intro to Administration of Justice` (5 wordings/26 colleges), then Principles & Procedures, then Criminal Investigation. **156 of 2,159 groups carry a decision; top 50 strings = 49.4% of all articulations — an afternoon, not an ocean.** ⚠️ **Units are NOT identity** (`SPAN 100` at 4/4.5/5) — a screen on rung 4 ONLY; rung 1/2/3 override it, so `Engine Performance` correctly merges 2/3-4/4/5 units and the spread is **always displayed**. ⚠️ **Grouping is by KEY, NEVER transitive** — 164 strings bridge ≥2 course identities, so components would chain `AJ 110`↔*Community Relations*↔`AJ 160`. ⚠️ **Two gates DON'T work: `attribution='per_course'`** (every poisoned `AJ 110` row carries it) **and a line-fraction/cartesian test** (`AJ 110` hits 8 of POST's 43 → reads non-cartesian → sails through). The gate that works is the credential's **COURSE count**. ⚠️ **A normalization and the screens that judge it MUST see the same text** — `screen_profile()` ran on the raw topic while the key ran on the folded one, so `Intro`/`Introduction` read as different levels and the level screen **blocked the top of the queue**; then the test re-implemented the folds, missed `adv`, and failed two correct groups. Fixed by EMITTING the profile, not re-deriving it. Decisions live in gated Supabase `cr_reference_decisions` keyed on `group_key`, so a rebuild can never overwrite a judgment. **NEXT: Sam works the head — the top ~50 groups — and we watch which rungs he overrides.** Story: [`docs/common_cr_reference_lessons.md`](docs/common_cr_reference_lessons.md) · scope [`docs/common_cr_reference_scope.md`](docs/common_cr_reference_scope.md).
