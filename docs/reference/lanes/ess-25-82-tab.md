**What this lane is:** Turn the three bare outcome checkmarks into where-you-are / where-you-should-be / how-to-get-there, so colleges get unstuck and award real CPL in MAP.

## Status

🔨 **GROUNDWORK DONE, REWORK NOT BUILT** (SkyPlan, #1007/#1012/#1014). ⭐ **The measure is the DISPOSITION RATE** — share of a college's credit recommendations carrying any disposition (Applied / **Not Applicable** / In Process). Median **4.7%**; MVC 3rd · Bakersfield 6th · Cabrillo 13th of 106 — the ONLY metric matching Sam's own read (three volume metrics ranked Cabrillo 24th–29th). Counting N/A as work done is load-bearing: Cabrillo is 844 N/A vs 320 Applied, so an applied-only metric scores it 9% not 34%. **Applied, not transcribed, is this phase's target** (Sam's correction — transcribing actualises when outcomes funding is live). Data: 436,720 rows at Needs Action (81%); **top 20 exhibits = ~40%** of the backlog; **11,495 rows are "Credit Is Not Recommended"** = a free auto-N/A win. **Build rules:** every step a FRACTION not a check (the Veteran Star taught colleges that uploading is the finish line — applied ≈ JSTs at ratio 1.00); reframe the Star as a starting line; **never rank colleges publicly**. **Next:** the rework itself, then wire Malone's view (expected 8/7) into `fetch_custom_report.py` + `_build_cr_backlog.py`.
