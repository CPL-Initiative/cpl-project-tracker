# Library / where decks, films and documents live

**What this lane is:** one COBI tab that lists every deck, film, spreadsheet and
document the CPL Initiative makes, with a link to where the file lives, who it is
for, and the source that rebuilds it. And the rule behind it: **the files live in
the team Drive; the repos keep only the source.**

## Status

✅ **The tab is built** (`library.js`, under *Sierra & Team Tools*; the side
session beside S336, 2026-10-05). It reads `cpl_library` live behind the team
phrase and seeds twelve real pieces across nine occasions
(`kb/receipts/cpl_library_seed_2026-10-05.sql`, cohort
`library-seed-skyshelf@bot`). Needs attention is computed from each record:
**not filed** (no link anywhere a session can reach), **a public file with no
audience set** (in the public tracker repo and Sam has not said who it is for),
and **figures to refresh**. Add, File it, Edit and Retire write to the table;
nothing deletes, and a trigger files every prior row in `cpl_library_history`.
Approved mockup: https://claude.ai/artifact/VPpbDp7DD4acvHErVFkCqH.
Schema: `kb/supabase_cpl_library.sql`. Test: `tests/library.test.js`.

✅ **Start a piece is built** (2026-10-06, as mockup version 2 shows it). The brief form
(kind, now including spreadsheet; working title; occasion; needed by; for; what it must
say; sources; length or template) saves a record with status `requested` and the brief in
one `brief` jsonb column (migration `cpl_library_start_a_piece`). **In development** sits
above the register and holds every Requested record, and every briefed record still at
Draft, at its step of four (Requested, Draft, Approved, Presented). Approval moves a piece
into the register. A Requested record never counts as Not filed, because it has nothing to
file yet. *Copy the brief* gives the whole paste for a new session: the ask, the
`scripts/library_file.py` command for that record, and what a good result looks like.
Sam's routine reads Requested records as queue items (step 6 of *At the start* in
[`scheduled_sessions`](../scheduled_sessions.md)). The versions table shows the time
each version was filed (`filed_at`, call 8).

## Sam's rulings (2026-10-05, all in `cpl_memory`)

His ask: *"I think I may need a COBI tab to store and retrieve artifacts like this
ppt and video. Advise"*. Then, by number:

1. **Build the tab.**
2. **Drive is the home for approved files.** He named
   [the folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WNtaaKMGSYsKsdJLxi4fbR24fXD4fGUZ)
   and made **CPLLibrary** inside it
   ([13WnIL1j…](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13WnIL1j-Qo3CJ5znVFZhs5wmAjJqOxxN));
   the tab links there.
3. **Drafts stop going into the public tracker repo**, and the ones there come off main.
4. *"I think all artifacts like this created on this account should go to the
   Drive instead of the repos"* — **drafts go to Drive too**, in
   [CPLLibrary/Drafts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15eXeJb9OIl1nOFE4Tykr1y7rBGKBUvih)
   (created 2026-10-05), in place of private Claude players.
5. **Move the files already in the repos to Drive**: the public tracker first,
   then the vault.
6. **The manual hand-off now**; an automatic upload only if it grates.

## How a file reaches Drive

- **A session on Sam's machine (Cowork):** save into the Drive-synced folder.
- **A cloud session, through the Drive connector:** a file up to roughly 50 KB (it travels as
  base64 inside the tool call). Anything larger: Sam drops it in, and the session finds it with the
  connector (`search_files` by title and `parentId`) and files the link with **File it**.
- **A cloud session, directly (measured 2026-10-05):** the proxy lets the shell reach
  `www.googleapis.com/upload` and `oauth2.googleapis.com` (they answer 405 and 404), and rejects
  `script.google.com` and `*.supabase.co`. So with a stored Google sign-in for the camapinitiative
  account (an OAuth refresh token as an environment secret) a script can upload a file of any size,
  films included, with Drive's resumable upload.
- **Automatic upload (call 6, deferred; Sam raised auto-filing again 2026-10-05):** the direct
  route above, run by the session when it makes a piece. A Google service account likely cannot own
  files in a personal Gmail Drive, so it needs the account's own refresh token. Not built.

**What stays in a repo:** build scripts, specs, narration text and voice clips (a
library voice can be withdrawn), the vault's companion notes, and a film a public
page plays (the funding explainer's cuts stay where Pages serves them). Pipeline
outputs (`reports/*.docx`) and source documents under `docs/reference/` are
inputs, not deliverables. Claude artifacts (decision sheets, mockups) stay on
claude.ai.

## Filed in Drive so far

- **The five Title 5 tracked-changes documents** (CPLLibrary, 2026-10-05): uploaded by the session
  through the Drive connector, each at its exact byte size; the record links v5 and lists all five
  (receipt `kb/receipts/cpl_library_drive_t5_2026-10-05.sql`, guarded; the history trigger holds the
  before-row). Files keep their own date codes (the vault convention). Sam asked for titles that
  start with *"our date code 20261005"*; if he means the filing date for every file, a Drive rename
  keeps each link.
- **What a session can upload:** a file up to roughly 50 KB. The file travels as base64 inside the
  tool call, and Drive reports no checksum, so size is the check. The decks (43 and 200 KB), the CAC
  run sheet (155 KB) and the films (8 to 16 MB) go by hand: Sam drops them in, the session files the
  link.

## Sam's calls 7-9 (2026-10-05, "7, 8,9 Y")

7. **Build the automatic filer.** A session files each piece to Drive the moment it makes it,
   films included, and writes the Library record in the same step. Setup is Sam's once: a Google
   Cloud project with the Drive API on, an OAuth client, one consent as camapinitiative, and three
   environment secrets (`GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
   `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN`; read `read_documentation` topic `environment.secrets` and walk him
   through it). Check first whether the `drive.file` scope may write into CPLLibrary, a folder the
   app did not create; if not, use the full Drive scope. Then `scripts/library_file.py <path>`:
   resumable upload to CPLLibrary or Drafts, the Drive link back, the Library row written.
8. **Versions are separate files.** Each edit uploads `<date code>_<name>_vN`, keeping the original
   date code; the record's version list gains a row with the time filed. Never rely on Drive's own
   revision history, which drops versions after 30 days unless pinned.
9. **Decision sheets** stay Claude pages (the reply buttons need the artifact store). Each gets a
   Library record (kind document, occasion "Open asks") linking its artifact, with no Drive copy.
   Their sources (47 open-asks sheets in `docs/visuals/`) leave the public tracker repo for the
   private vault repo; `kb/_build_open_asks_decision_sheet.py` and `docs/reference/decision_sheets.md`
   move with them.

## Next

- **PR 2, the move (call 5):** when Sam has dropped in the BOG and CBO decks, the CAC run sheet, the
  Ironworker film and the two Noncredit Summit cuts, point their records at Drive (guarded update,
  receipt), remove the deliverable binaries from main (the five Title 5 files can go now; `.gitignore`
  `exports/*.docx`, and `kb/_build_55050_redline_docx.py` still writes there), take the Summit film's
  two player pages off the site, and add a guard test so a deliverable binary cannot be committed
  again. Then the vault's binaries (29 on 2026-10-05).
- **Open with Sam:** whether the Ironworker player page stays public; sharing CPLLibrary with the
  team (owner-only today).
