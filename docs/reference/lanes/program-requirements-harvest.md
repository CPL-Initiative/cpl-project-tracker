# Program requirements harvest

**What this lane is:** for every active program at the 115 credit colleges, a
record of how its courses count toward the award (required, choose N courses or
units from a list, open elective), the program total, the catalog year and the
source, plus the recommended term sequence where a college publishes one. From
it: which courses a learner qualifies for through CPL, and the units saved.

## Status

🔨 **Phase 0 (the census) built (S320, #1836; reader corrections S321-S322),
and the registry filled by apply on `main`.** Sam's three
statements that opened the lane are verbatim in the vault:
`CPLBrain/03-professional/braindumps/braindump-2026-10-03-1433-program-requirements-from-local-catalogs.md`.
The plan is a Claude Doc Sam edits and comments on:
[Program Requirements Harvest Plan](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/77ae8cb2-443b-45e3-b287-594c9c9b8744).

**The registry** (`kb/supabase_program_source_registry.sql`, four migrations applied live 2026-10-03): one row per college, a history table, one write path (`program_source_census_apply`, service role only), anon SELECT. Columns and Sam's 2026-10-03 rulings: lessons, S419.

**The census** (`kb/_program_source_census.py`, `program-source-census.yml`): reads each college's homepage on a runner, scores and dates its catalog link, applies weekly on `main` (Sundays 10:29 UTC). Its rules, politeness limits and governance note: lessons archive, S334. Guard: `tests/program_source_census_test.py`.

**Sheets 23, 25 and 26 rulings:** lessons (S335 compaction).

**Measured (2026-10-03):** the Program Course File names every course a program lists (the closed list each record is checked against) but marks none required. Detail: lessons archive, S334.

**The pilot (Phase 1): all 20 records pass all four checks** (Cerritos, Mt. San Antonio, Riverside City, West LA, Miramar; Sam read them, 18 matched and both fixes went in). Capture `kb/_program_requirements_pilot.py`, extraction the `program-requirements-extract` Edge Function, scorer `kb/_program_requirements_score.py`; guard `tests/program_requirements_pilot_test.py`. Detail: lessons, S372.

**The sequence pass (S325) and a refused mapper host:** lessons, S394.

**A refusal is on the college's record (Sam, sheet 29 card 3, revised 2026-10-17):** `program_source_registry` carries `sequence_host`, `sequence_access`, `sequence_note`, `sequence_checked_run`, and `access_status` for the catalog. ⚠️ **Automated reads still name the CPL Initiative in the user agent and still respect blocks and robots.txt.** Since Sam's rulings of 2026-10-17 (`cpl_memory` `sam-sheet-29-revised-refusal-workarounds-2026-10-17`), a person may fetch a public file by hand for the pipeline (the hand-filed step, `kb/hand_filed_catalogs/`), and the CO may ask a college or vendor for access (the access-note drafts in `CPLBrain/04-projects/cpl-initiative/20261017_Catalog_Reader_Access_Notes_Draft_1.md`; Sam sends them). Detail and the 25 colleges filed: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S386 compaction)*.

**Sam's ruling (2026-10-04, 11:1xZ, in chat):** *"No need for governance at this
point. Everything is public record and we can mark the tab and contents as beta
draft."* The harvest's tab shows its records without a Governance pass, marked
**Beta draft** (vault braindump
`braindump-2026-10-04-1115-program-requirements-tab-public-record.md`). Then:
*"Integrate Sierra in the tab design."*

**The tab is in COBI** (Beta draft, #1860, Reference & Curation): `program_requirements.js` ports the approved mock-up ([v3](https://claude.ai/artifact/DkfRYLpyusuqYy6ErqQe6f), Sam: *"mock up looks good"*) and reads `program_source_registry` and `program_requirement_records` live. Five views: Progress, Catalogs, Sequences, Procedures (each college's procedure record) and the List; no Sierra (Sam, 2026-10-14, guard `(4b)`). Two early notes (the unscoped surface, Cerritos's Ironworker): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S542 compaction)*.

**The List (2026-11-01, `#program-requirements/list`):** the Catalog Commons' shared List (`commons_list.js`), one row per active COCI program (20,282), read only; its columns, the control-number join and the timing at 20,282 rows: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S542 compaction)*. Guard `tests/program_requirements_list.test.js`. **The List is the workspace (2026-11-04, the List norms):** the engine's line of the requirements row in `kb/status/commons.json` (its issues set Fail a machine check and Not read yet), the Progress view's opened page folded behind *Hide the summary* (prefix `prl-pg-`), and a program's side panel: its record's checks in words, its courses block by block with title, units and the CPL on record at the college, and COCI's words folded; a light record is read once from the panel. Guard `tests/program_requirements_list_panel.test.js`. **Program records retired into the List (SkyLoquat, 2026-11-04, PR 3 of 3, after #2769 and #2771):** the panel carries the record's card (the checks in full, the flags, the chips, the CPL dialog, Your reading) and drafts the message to the college (*Draft the message to …*, reading the college's records once; Catalogs' drafts count opens the List on the college); side by side draws the full card. An older `view: "records"` address still opens the List. Guards `tests/program_requirements_list_record_port.test.js` and `tests/program_requirements.test.js`, whose card checks read side by side.

**Catalog addenda** (`program_source_addenda`; 79 listed at 52 colleges; the eight amending loaded colleges read, S387-S388; the other 71 as the reader reaches their colleges): lessons, S394.

**CPL Pathways reads the ROEP record (Sam, 2026-10-04 ~17:20Z):** *"we use the
new tab based on mockup to manage the ongoing process to harvest program ROE and
Pathway data and CPL Pathways to show it graphically to the colleges and public...
My goal is to not need to curate or manually adjust and instead to adjust
college-based procedures to arrive at accurate catalog ROEP dataset"* (vault
braindump, 2026-10-04 17:20). The
harvest tab runs the reading; CPL Pathways shows every record, checked or not, each
marked (Sierra's "required" stays on the checked gate). No record is edited by
hand: a misread is filed against the college's reading procedure; a place where the
catalog and the state's Program Course File disagree goes to the college (10 of 20
pilot records).
**The map names the pick inside a choice**; the catalog keeps the rule. Mock-up:
[CPL Pathways ROEP](https://claude.ai/artifact/8hkej9jHsmLRX6cZYxrXbM). ✅ **Ported (S334):** the pathway selector lists every catalog record (Beta draft) (its two views: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S542 compaction)*). Guard `tests/cpl_pathways_roep_view.test.js`; a11y targets `cpl-pathways-roep` and `-dark`.

**Sam's sheets 29 and 32 (2026-10-04)** (Sierra's "required"; "up to" and CPL in three kinds): lessons, S422 compaction.

**The display build** (`kb/_build_roep_display.py`) writes each program's facts once, under one build stamp, to `program_requirement_records.display` (Sierra) and `cpl_pathways_roep_data.js` (the page); guard `tests/roep_display_test.py`. Its history (S327-S336): the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S346 compaction)*.

**Outcomes (Sam, 2026-10-04):** course and program outcomes beside the harvested credential skills. `course_outcomes` holds 10,311 rows at thirteen colleges (Santa Ana 2026-11-03, S559; Las Positas 2026-11-04, S567; Columbia 2026-11-05, S578); the skills comparison waits for `kb/reference/industry_credential_skills.json` (lessons, S413). **The SLO read nightly in the CPL queue, to build** (Sam, 2026-11-01, in chat: *"yes to SLO hints and the nightly harvest"*): the colleges that articulate the most exhibits first; `course-outcomes-read.yml` and `-load.yml` are dispatch-only today.

**Course objectives too (Sam, 2026-11-02, S551):** *"Since we are grabbing leaning outcomes, we should grab course objectives and store them as well. They are often richer descriptions of course content than any other element of the COR and we will need this when we star solving for the edge cases of the common course reference."* **Built (S584):** the reader files objectives as `course_outcomes.kind` `objective`; detail: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S590)*. **NEXT:** (4) the ten loaded colleges read once more for objectives (runner minutes only, no model call), most exhibit articulations first, one host at a time, after Mission's read; a full read files no page text, so it cannot be a reparse.

**The nightly SLO read (Sam, 2026-11-01: *"yes to SLO hints and the nightly harvest"*):** step 11 of [`scheduled_sessions`](../scheduled_sessions.md), most exhibit articulations first (`scripts/next_slo_colleges.py`); a host that prints none gets a verdict in `kb/course_outcomes/queue.json`. Pages only, no model call, so no cost. Loads so far (Golden West, Santa Ana, Las Positas, Columbia, with runs and receipts): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S584)*. **Mission College's full read is running** (S589, run 42186782928, `parts=2`, #2800; part 1 filed complete 08:51Z 2026-11-06). **Lake Tahoe's trial parsed 11 of 12** (S589, run 42186810315, #2833), so it moves to *read*. **Next:** load Mission once both slices file complete (write `.load` as printed, merge once the receipt is on the branch); on 2026-11-07 UTC, Lake Tahoe's full read on #2833 (the day's one full read).

**CSU LA:** later (Sam, sheet 33 card 3; lessons S336).

**The Cerritos Ironworker proof of concept** (the ladder on CPL Pathways), the reader `kb/_college_page_read.py` with its plans in `kb/college_reads/`, and **one procedure record per college** written through `program_source_procedure_set(college, record, by, expect_md5)` (service role, md5-guarded, history trigger): the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S346 compaction)*.

✅ **Sheets 38, 39 and 42's rulings:** lessons, *Moved from the lane (S336 compaction)*. ✅ **The Progress view (S343, #1900):** the tab's first view, from the mock-up Sam approved (*"The mockup looks good to go"*). `MILESTONES` and `PARTS` at its top are definitions; the tables are read live; what anon cannot read comes from **`kb/status/program-requirements.json`** (`kb/queue_status.json` until S418), written at every checkpoint (step 12, `scripts/queue_status.py`), never from a widened policy. **The view is drawn by the Commons' shared module `commons_progress.js` since S419** (the Commons' step 1; [commons lane](commons.md)): this tab keeps its definitions (`MILESTONES`, `PARTS`, `WHOLE`, `HEADLINE`, `PROGRESS`) and its live reads, and lends the module its sections and count controls. Detail: lessons S343. Every count opens what it totals; a card waiting on Sam links where he answers (#2077); a call in `kb/queue_status.json` must carry its answer link (`link`, `view` or `records`) and may name its card (`part`). *Whole harvest* and *Complete*: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S542 compaction)*. A status-file note replaces its card's live foot, so delete one the moment it stops being true. **NEXT:** ① Re-read Schedule+ for Spring 2027 once its IWAP sections post. ② The film: re-render when a ladder line it shows changes. ③ The addenda reading agent after the 2026-10-11 apply; Miramar's map (`read: 1`); Butte's ROE definitions; every loaded college holds a procedure record (S395). Refresh the builder's two dated reads when the harvest adds a college. Later (Sam, ~20:02Z): every program with ROEP in a SkyView view ([skyview lane](skyview-ccr-interface.md)).

**Sheet 50 and the maps (S346-S347):** lessons (S353 compaction).

🔨 **Phase 2, a college at a time: 114 colleges hold records (15,946; S414), every new record unchecked until read.** `kb/_program_requirements_college.py` on `program-requirements-college.yml` (its readers: the catalog sweep, below); `assign()` gives a page to the programs whose award and title it names most fully. A push reads only on `[read]`/`[extract]`; a dispatch runs `step=read`, `load` or `display`. The load is insert-only and commits a receipt naming every inserted key, which is the rollback; a record placing none of its listed courses (another program's page) stays out of the load and the display build. **Loaded:** the newest wave is the catalog sweep's, below; the earlier waves' names and counts: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S399 compaction)* and S401. **Display:** each build applies through the display job, which files each row's prior build (the rollback); Sam's standing go (2026-10-10) covers a build that follows a load. **Extraction runs with no card up to $40 a college** (Sam, 2026-10-14, S393; `sam-extraction-standing-go-40-per-college-2026-10-14`); above $40 it is a card. The display job applies the build `cpl_pathways_roep_data.js` carries: run `kb/_build_roep_display.py` and commit its two outputs before dispatching (lessons S385). A program pointing at a retired version of a course the college still offers lists it, placed, no flag (Sam, 2026-10-11, Cerritos 02226). A college must be in the builder's dated reads (`kb/program_requirements_pilot/`, `registry_read.json` and `map_cr_by_course.json`) before its display is built; Earlier colleges' reads and rulings (S385-S398): lessons archive 3, *Moved from the lane (S495 compaction)*. 

🔨 **The reconcile pass (S392; Sam, 2026-10-14: "a secondary search of the catalog text to see if we can reconcile after the initial PR harvest", each catalog's own steps; `cpl_memory` `sam-reconcile-pass-after-harvest-2026-10-14`).** `kb/_program_requirements_reconcile.py` applies a college's steps (`kb/program_requirements_reconcile.json`) at extraction and on filed records (`step=reconcile`, no model call); each change names the words it came from. Orange Coast's and Monterey Peninsula's steps, Cabrillo's and Cerritos's, and Sheet 85's rulings on them (Sam, 2026-10-16, `sam-sheet-85-rulings-2026-10-16`; Victor Valley 37006 and 38352 stay as read, unchecked, shown and flagged): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S402 compaction)*.

Hartnell 83 of 94 and Delta 200 of 203: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S530 compaction)*.
**Glendale (S505, S523-S528; its 2025-26 PDF):** 115 of 226 loaded records pass (S527, from 110). Every course is priced from its own
description (`units_file`; lessons S523, S526), the C-numbers from the runner's parse (S527). Prose totals and the IT Technician pair: lessons S524-S526; the catalog's own sums: S528.
**PARKED (S527, the stopping rule; Sam, 2026-10-30):** two sessions under 3% each. The to-do `glendale-parked-2026-10-30` names what restarts it: [`scheduled_sessions`](../scheduled_sessions.md).
✅ **Sam, Sheet 144 card 2 *floor* (17:50Z 2026-10-30, his own call):** a choose-courses list's printed units are its floor, never its ceiling (`block_units`; `block_units_summed` keeps the reading before it). The S529 rescore and its live apply (Sheet 146 card 2): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S542 compaction)*. NEXT: the display build.
**Los Angeles Valley (S530-S534; its 2026-27 PDF): parked at 202 of 215** (`lavc-parked-2026-10-31`, the stopping rule). Its steps and the 13 left: lessons S530-S534.

**Monterey Peninsula (S535-S536; its 2026-27 CourseLeaf site): 183 of 197 passing**. Its steps: MPC GE 24-34, Cal-GETC 34 (both years' words), the 60 a floor ("electives, if needed"), `or_units`, `and_units` (a lab printed joined to its lecture, "CSIS 50 · & 50L", takes 0). The 14 left: lessons S536. S536 moved 7 (3.6%), so one more session under 3% parks it. **RULED (Sam, Open Asks Sheet 159 card 1, 22:51Z 2026-11-02, his own call: "keep"):** the 60 stays a floor, as S535 read it. **S590 (#2809):** the six unequal records read back (page read 42046379839); two steps on the catalog's words: the floor for transfer degrees too (Global Studies 37243; Fable advised) and `or_units` `parent_from_block` (Accounting 22052's "Select one of the following: 2 · WORK 96 · or WORK 99"). Reconcile 42195216637 dispatched. The other four need reader work or stay as printed: ASL 39266 (an `&`-joined alternative pair), Hospitality 41831 ("Any List A course not already selected" dropped), Nursing 03633 (Humanities and Ethnic Studies lines not kept), Anthropology 32033 (the catalog's own 23 counts List C at 4: leave). **NEXT:** read the reconcile's result on #2809, reread (`step=reread`), display build on the branch, merge; then count against the stopping rule (3% is 6 of 197): S584 moved none (a page read) and S590 at most 2, so two sessions in a row fall under it and the college parks once the reread is read back, with the four reader items as the call that turns it on.

🔨 **The catalog sweep (S394-S414; Sam's aim of 2026-10-14: every catalog, then curated audit sweeps).** The standing rules: one branch per college, never two on one host; a free capture-only read (`extract=0`) where a host's shape is new, and a free page read (`kb/college_reads/`) before any reader change, verified on the catalog's own words before any dispatch; **dispatch every read with `college=`**; extraction under the $40 go. **A reconcile rescores a record only on the page it was extracted from, or a fresh capture printing the record's own heading** (`own_heading_kept`, S530), and a reconcile step for a figure a local degree never carries reads transfer degrees only (`awards: transfer`). **`step=display` applies the committed build; it never builds one** (run `kb/_build_roep_display.py` on the wave branch first). **Sam's go of 2026-10-17:** harvest calls proceed on their procedures without a card; a write the Supabase guard holds goes through `supabase-migrate.yml`. **Sheet 118 card 1:** each wave's older-build rows are removed with a before-values receipt (the S456 method), no card; Sam ruled **narrow** on the scorer's `meets` reading (Sheet 120 card 1); no note to Program Mapper's vendor for now (Sheet 112 card 1). The two S448 offers wait on Sam's word. **List the thin colleges live, and look for a shared cause, first** (S442). On screen the reference is **CPL Pathways**. **No record (4):** North Orange Continuing Education, San Jose City, Diablo Valley, Santiago Canyon. Readers, invariants, waves, parked colleges and renumbers: the paragraph as it stood, lessons, *Moved from the lane (S562)*, and the pointers it carries.

**The second reader, Grok** (Sheet 97 card 1; built S421, #2246) waits on the xAI billing moving to the RCCD district card and two Edge Function secrets only Sam sets: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S530 compaction)*.

✅ **A light index, full records by key or by college** (S384, Sam 2026-10-13, `cpl_memory` `sam-records-load-by-college-filter-2026-10-13`; the cap, the anon timeout and #2088-#2090, #2121: lessons, S385 and S542 compactions). **The index reads stored columns** (S405, guard `tests/program_requirements.test.js` 6e; lessons, S411). The Records view's college sections and its CIP batch read retired with it (SkyLoquat, 2026-11-04); the List's CIP Sector reads COCI's own CIP.

Sheet 77 card 3 (#2093, #2097): lessons (S387 compaction).

✅ **Flags and a person's reading are built (S347; Sam, Sheet 51 card 1).** Confirm or Needs a fix writes `program_record_verdicts` through `program_record_verdict_add`; a trigger keeps a person's reading across a reload. Detail: lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S356 compaction)*.
