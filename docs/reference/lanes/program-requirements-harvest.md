# Program requirements harvest

**What this lane is:** for every active program at the 115 credit colleges, a
record of how its courses count toward the award (required, choose N courses or
units from a list, open elective), the program total, the catalog year and the
source, plus the recommended term sequence where a college publishes one. From
it: which courses a learner qualifies for through CPL, and the units saved.

## Status

🔨 **Phase 0 (the census) built (S320, #1836; reader corrections S321-S322),
and the registry filled by apply on `main`.** Sam's three
statements that opened the lane are verbatim in the vault:
`CPLBrain/03-professional/braindumps/braindump-2026-10-03-1433-program-requirements-from-local-catalogs.md`.
The plan is a Claude Doc Sam edits and comments on:
[Program Requirements Harvest Plan](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/77ae8cb2-443b-45e3-b287-594c9c9b8744).

**The registry** (`kb/supabase_program_source_registry.sql`, applied live
2026-10-03 as four migrations):
- `program_source_registry`: one row per college in `coci_college_programs`
  (118: 115 with credit programs, the two continuing-education colleges,
  Calbright), keyed by the catalog-data college name, seeded with an https
  homepage from the CEO list. Calbright College Credit has no `map_colleges` id.
  Columns follow the plan's registry table: catalog URL and year, platform,
  format, CMS public view, sequence source and URL, best method, access status
  and notes, trust evidence (Phase 1), the census's evidence and run id, and
  `corrected_by` / `corrected_at` / `correction_note` for a person.
- `program_source_registry_history`: a trigger files every prior row on UPDATE
  or DELETE, naming the census run or the person. A run rolls back from it.
- `program_source_census_apply(run_id, rows)`: the census's only write. A row
  with `corrected_by` set keeps its values; the census files its reading in
  `census_evidence.census_values` and sets `census_disagrees`. Service role
  only. anon and authenticated hold SELECT on the registry and nothing else
  on either table.

**The census** (`kb/_program_source_census.py`, `program-source-census.yml`): reads each college's homepage on a runner, scores and dates its catalog link, applies weekly on `main` (Sundays 10:29 UTC). Its rules, politeness limits and governance note: the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S334 compaction)*. Guard: `tests/program_source_census_test.py`.

**Sam's rulings (2026-10-03):** build our own best version now; the Butte
College Tech Center's COCI ROE fields are a parallel track, never a gate
(*"working on that end is often a slog or dead end"*); start from use cases and
test against real catalog pages; a per-college source registry kept current by
agents; a per-college tab; an agent per college that the college and the MAP
team own and train. S320: "Go" on the registry table as described (its
history, its one write path, a public read); "Approved" on the push that adds
the weekly apply.

**Sam's sheet 23, 25 and 26 rulings** (the pilot's shape, who checks it, runners reading slowly): the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S335 compaction)*.

**Measured (2026-10-03):** the Program Course File names every course a program lists (the closed list each record is checked against) but marks none required. Detail: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S334 compaction)*.

**The pilot (Phase 1): all 20 records pass all four checks** (Cerritos, Mt. San Antonio, Riverside City, West LA, Miramar; Sam read them, 18 matched and both fixes went in). Capture `kb/_program_requirements_pilot.py`, extraction the `program-requirements-extract` Edge Function, scorer `kb/_program_requirements_score.py`; guard `tests/program_requirements_pilot_test.py`. Detail: the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S372)*.

**The sequence pass (S325) and a refused mapper host:** lessons, *Moved from the lane (S394 compaction)*.

**A refusal is on the college's record (Sam, sheet 29 card 3):** the agent notes the limitation and keeps looking, and asks no one for access; `program_source_registry` carries `sequence_host`, `sequence_access`, `sequence_note`, `sequence_checked_run`. ⚠️ **A workaround is another public source, never the same refused host under another name**: the reader keeps the census user agent that names the CPL Initiative. Detail and the 25 colleges filed: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S386 compaction)*.

**Sam's ruling (2026-10-04, 11:1xZ, in chat):** *"No need for governance at this
point. Everything is public record and we can mark the tab and contents as beta
draft."* The harvest's tab shows its records without a Governance pass, marked
**Beta draft** (vault braindump
`braindump-2026-10-04-1115-program-requirements-tab-public-record.md`). Then:
*"Integrate Sierra in the tab design."*

**The tab is in COBI** (Beta draft, #1860, Reference & Curation): `program_requirements.js` ports the approved mock-up ([v3](https://claude.ai/artifact/DkfRYLpyusuqYy6ErqQe6f), Sam: *"mock up looks good"*) and reads `program_source_registry` and `program_requirement_records` live. Four views: Catalogs, Program records (the four checks; the display build's CPL figure), Sequences, and Procedures (each college's procedure record). Sierra docks at the top (sheet 38 card 5; Sam: *"Sierra at the top"*): a collapsible Sierra AI section mounts the CPL Assistant (`CPL_CHAT.mountInto(host, "program-requirements")`); `cpl-chat` reads the surface as unscoped until `KNOWN_SURFACES` names it (a deploy). Cerritos's Ironworker A.S. reads 0 MAP credit recs (its credit is exhibit articulation, in CER).

**Catalog addenda** (`program_source_addenda`; 79 listed at 52 colleges; the eight amending loaded colleges read, S387-S388; the other 71 as the reader reaches their colleges): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S394 compaction)*.

**Sam's sheet 29 (2026-10-04):** Sierra says "required", names each choose block and gives the printed total for a checked program, citing the catalog and its year (live, smokes 7l and 7q).

**CPL Pathways reads the ROEP record (Sam, 2026-10-04 ~17:20Z):** *"we use the
new tab based on mockup to manage the ongoing process to harvest program ROE and
Pathway data and CPL Pathways to show it graphically to the colleges and public...
My goal is to not need to curate or manually adjust and instead to adjust
college-based procedures to arrive at accurate catalog ROEP dataset"* (vault
braindump, 2026-10-04 17:20). The
harvest tab runs the reading; CPL Pathways shows every record, checked or not, each
marked (Sierra's "required" stays on the checked gate). No record is edited by
hand: a misread is filed against the college's reading procedure; a place where the
catalog and the state's Program Course File disagree goes to the college (10 of 20
pilot records).
**The map names the pick inside a choice**; the catalog keeps the rule. Mock-up:
[CPL Pathways ROEP](https://claude.ai/artifact/8hkej9jHsmLRX6cZYxrXbM). ✅ **Ported (S334):** the pathway selector lists every catalog record (Beta draft); each opens By requirement (tiles, an option fork, CPL in three kinds in words, the checks, the outcomes, the gaps read-only) or By term (the map's status, every course in the tray), for the College or Student or public viewer. Guard `tests/cpl_pathways_roep_view.test.js`; a11y targets `cpl-pathways-roep` and `-dark`.

**Sam's sheet 32 (2026-10-04):** a program shows "up to" plus the recommended path's figure, each course carries CPL in three kinds (articulated here, could adopt, for consideration), and catalog-and-state-file differences go to the college as drafts on the harvest tab and My College while the MAP team sends. Verbatim: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S386 compaction)*.

**The display build** (`kb/_build_roep_display.py`) writes each program's facts once, under one build stamp, to `program_requirement_records.display` (Sierra) and `cpl_pathways_roep_data.js` (the page); guard `tests/roep_display_test.py`. Its history (S327-S336): the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S346 compaction)*.

**Outcomes (Sam, 2026-10-04 18:03Z):** grab published course and program outcomes, and compare harvested credential skills with course outcomes. 🔨 **Course outlines (Sam, 2026-10-12, `sam-capture-cor-system-link-2026-10-12`):** capture each college's course outline of record system link so the harvest reads course SLOs, for the skills match and for faculty assessment of CPL. Record shape 3, Sheet 70's rulings, the registry's `cor_*` fields, the census, the index and how each host prints its SLOs: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S376 compaction)* and *(S380 compaction)*. ✅ **`course_outcomes` is live** (Sam pasted `chatbox/supabase_course_outcomes.sql`, Open Asks Sheet 72 card 1; public read, insert-only `course_outcomes_load()` on the service role, a receipt per load). **Loaded, nine colleges, 7,450 courses, 20,891 SLOs** (live read, S388): RCCD (#2049: Riverside City 1,174, Norco 817, Moreno Valley 674), SDCCD (#2066: San Diego City 588, Mesa 1,026, Miramar 615), and from catalog course pages addressed by code: Cabrillo 1,124 and Modesto Junior 910 on eLumen (#2103), Coastline 522 from the Coast district's outlines of record (#2105; 28 common course numbers answer 404 there). `catalog=<slug>` in `kb/course_outcomes/.run` picks either form; each load is insert-only with a receipt naming its rollback. **Chaffey** (#2073): neither public report prints course outcomes. Cerritos, Long Beach City and Mt. San Antonio print none on their CourseLeaf pages (#2101). **Palo Verde held** for its 2026-27 Acalog catalog (reader merged, #2112). COBI shows the SLOs on Program records' course rows and in COCI Lookup (#2116, Sam 2026-10-14). The skills comparison waits for `kb/reference/industry_credential_skills.json` (not started).

**CSU LA:** later, after the CCC procedure settles (Sam, sheet 33 card 3; lessons, S336 compaction).

**The Cerritos Ironworker proof of concept** (the ladder on CPL Pathways), the reader `kb/_college_page_read.py` with its plans in `kb/college_reads/`, and **one procedure record per college** written through `program_source_procedure_set(college, record, by, expect_md5)` (service role, md5-guarded, history trigger): the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S346 compaction)*.

✅ **Sheets 38, 39 and 42's rulings:** lessons, *Moved from the lane (S336 compaction)*. ✅ **The Progress view (S343, #1900):** the tab's first view, from the mock-up Sam approved (*"The mockup looks good to go"*). `MILESTONES` and `PARTS` at its top are definitions; the tables are read live; what anon cannot read comes from **`kb/queue_status.json`**, written at every checkpoint (step 12, `scripts/queue_status.py`), never from a widened policy. Detail: lessons S343. Every count opens what it totals; a card waiting on Sam links where he answers (#2077); a call in `kb/queue_status.json` must carry its answer link (`link`, `view` or `records`) and may name its card (`part`). **Whole harvest** (Sam, 2026-10-13): five parts, confirm left out; `queue_status.py --harvest` stamps it. **NEXT:** ① Re-read Schedule+ for Spring 2027 once its IWAP sections post. ② The film: re-render when a ladder line it shows changes. ③ The addenda reading agent after the 2026-10-11 apply; Miramar's map (`read: 1`); Butte's ROE definitions; every loaded college holds a procedure record (S395). Maps: 3 of 32 read, 24 mapper hosts refused (lessons S345). Refresh the builder's two dated reads when the harvest adds a college. Later (Sam, ~20:02Z): every program with ROEP in a SkyView view ([skyview lane](skyview-ccr-interface.md)).

**Sheet 50 and the maps it settled (S346-S347):** the lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S353 compaction)*.

🔨 **Phase 2, a college at a time: forty-seven colleges read and loaded, every new record unchecked until read.** `kb/_program_requirements_college.py` on `program-requirements-college.yml` reads a CourseLeaf catalog by its sitemap and a curriQunet catalog by its own JSON (`cq_index`, `cq_page`; a catalog id from the host's `_getCatalogs` when the start page names none); `assign()` gives a page to the programs whose award and title it names most fully. A push reads only on `[read]`/`[extract]`; a dispatch runs `step=read`, `load` or `display`. The load is insert-only and commits a receipt naming every inserted key, which is the rollback; a record placing none of its listed courses (another program's page) stays out of the load and the display build. **Loaded:** Cerritos 305, Mt. San Antonio 382, Riverside City 244, Moreno Valley 139, Norco 147, Long Beach City 344, Chaffey 191, San Diego City 167, San Diego Miramar 120, San Diego Mesa 175, Bakersfield 229 (eLumen, S381), Coastline 140, Cabrillo 268 (S382), Modesto Junior 185 and Palo Verde 52 (S385), Southwestern 190 (S389), Fresno City 211 (S390, #2120), El Camino 117 and San Joaquin Delta 202 (S392, the Acalog reader; Sam, Open Asks Sheet 81 cards 3 and 5), and the catalog sweep (S394, #2143, #2144): Santa Barbara City 242, Orange Coast 206, Foothill 97, Sierra 25, Fullerton 311, Citrus 144, Victor Valley 169, Monterey Peninsula 197; wave 3 (S395, #2149): Cypress 251, San Bernardino Valley 200, Cuyamaca 179, Sequoias 118, Mt. San Jacinto 94, Napa Valley 94, Evergreen Valley 74, Moorpark 54, Golden West 50, MiraCosta 18; wave 4 (S396-S398; #2157, build `66b50c86891e`; #2158, build `fa8ee2a84935`): Ventura 101, Oxnard 64, Reedley 36, Palomar 220, Chabot 231, Allan Hancock 153, Santa Ana 346, Rio Hondo 288, Saddleback 311. Procedure records come from `kb/_program_source_procedure_v1.py` (#2146); an existing record gets a v2 merged in SQL. **Display:** each build applies through the display job, which files each row's prior build (the rollback); Sam's standing go (2026-10-10) covers a build that follows a load. **Extraction runs with no card up to $40 a college** (Sam, 2026-10-14, S393; `sam-extraction-standing-go-40-per-college-2026-10-14`); above $40 it is a card. Build `0a22233cf694` holds all 3,797 rows (display run 38639117185, S392; its applied record is the rollback): 1,487 associate degrees holding the major only carry the **Major only** gap (#2129), 14 degree-total misses the units chip with the degree's figures (#2128). The display job applies the build `cpl_pathways_roep_data.js` carries: run `kb/_build_roep_display.py` and commit its two outputs before dispatching (lessons S385). A program pointing at a retired version of a course the college still offers lists it, placed, no flag (Sam, 2026-10-11, Cerritos 02226). A college must be in the builder's dated reads (`kb/program_requirements_pilot/`, `registry_read.json` and `map_cr_by_course.json`) before its display is built; ✅ Modesto and Palo Verde's dated reads, loads and build (S385, #2094): lessons. Palo Verde's noncredit pages and its pages that print the degree total with general education (S386): lessons. ⚠️ **Palo Verde's records are a year behind (S387):** its catalog page lists the 2026-27 catalog at `catalog.paloverde.edu` (Acalog); the census took the 2025-26 eLumen one. #2104 fixed the pick (applies 2026-10-18); the Acalog reader (#2112) then reads all 52. Sheet 78's carry-out, record shape 5, the re-read path, the Palo Verde, Cabrillo and Southwestern re-reads (S389): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S392 compaction)*. ✅ **Open Asks Sheet 81 (Sam, 2026-10-14 20:22Z, all five his own call; `sam-sheet-81-rulings-2026-10-14`):** card 1 *count*: a degree total inside the span the blocks, general education and open electives allow adds up (`within`); card 2 *adt*: a transfer degree printing its total and no electives is filled by transferable electives (`transfer`, `fill`; Ed. Code 66746(a)). `degree_verdict()` in the scorer holds both; `kb/_program_requirements_rescore.py` applied them to the filed records (35: Cabrillo 29 within and 1 transfer, 35651; Palo Verde 2 within and 3 transfer) and the live rows' `checks.arithmetic` moved through `supabase-migrate.yml` (receipt `kb/receipts/program_requirement_records_rescore_2026-10-14_s392.json`, its rollback inside). ✅ Card 3 El Camino and card 5 San Joaquin Delta: extracted ($8.08, $13.42), loaded unchecked (117, 202) and displayed (S392).

🔨 **The reconcile pass (S392; Sam, 2026-10-14: "a secondary search of the catalog text to see if we can reconcile after the initial PR harvest", each catalog's own steps; `cpl_memory` `sam-reconcile-pass-after-harvest-2026-10-14`).** `kb/_program_requirements_reconcile.py` applies a college's steps (`kb/program_requirements_reconcile.json`) at extraction and on filed records (`step=reconcile`, no model call); each change names the words it came from. Cabrillo's first run (38639316727) and the re-read that holds only a checked row (#2130): lessons S392. ✅ **Sheet 82 (Sam, 22:14Z; `sam-sheet-82-rulings-2026-10-14`):** a confirm carries over a rerun that changes only degree figures (*carry*); a transfer degree whose major and general education overlap past its total adds up (*overlap*). ✅ Both built (S393, #2136; lessons S393). 🔨 **Cerritos's steps (S393, #2139):** a minimum of 60 (`degree_total_minimum`), CGEC 24-28 by a `set` step, electives as needed; Major only 148 to 56, re-read live; Merged and applied (build `45fdd29240cb`). ✅ Extraction v10 (#2141, S394): units a block holds never count twice; Cabrillo 06350 and 06378 read 60 of 60. **Orange Coast and Monterey Peninsula's steps (S396):** Orange Coast reads its Requirements tab's "Total Minimum Degree Units - OCC AS GE 60" as a minimum, "OCC AS General Education up to 21" as GE of at most 21 (min unstated) and its electives as making up the rest; reconcile 38843379313 changed 11 records (six now pass; about thirty keep the gap because their captured text lacks the tab's totals), reread 38847265701 replaced them. Monterey Peninsula: a local degree's GE is 24 to 34 (MPC GE's eight areas of three units, a sum the catalog does not print, and Cal-GETC's 34), a transfer degree's 34; its reconcile run 38844053281 was still capturing at the S396 sign-off, so its reread waits. **NEEDS SAM (S393):** keep the carry across a changed major total and general electives, and Cerritos's 60 as a minimum. **NEEDS SAM (S396):** Victor Valley's AUTO 82.0 printed with no units (37006, 38352), Orange Coast's "up to 21" and Monterey Peninsula's 24 (both proceeded on the recommendation). All on Open Asks Sheet 84.

🔨 **The catalog sweep (S394-S395; Sam's aim of 2026-10-14: every catalog, then curated audit sweeps).** One branch per college, never two on one host; a wave branch merges the loaded ones, their dated reads and one display build. Extraction runs under the $40 go (S394 $103.83, S395 $92.92, S396 about $175 across nine colleges). **Parked for the reader:** Diablo Valley (no program list in its eLumen catalog), Sierra (sitemap 404), Foothill (73 programs lost their page to a sibling award), San Jose City (8 of 90 found, none passing), MiraCosta (29 of 161), Orange Coast's 27 empty records, Reedley (36 of 200: its curriQunet index held 40 entries in 2 sections; 34 programs lost their page to a sibling and 130 matched none; a page read first). **Santa Ana:** titles put the award after a colon ("Accounting: A.S. Degree"), which #2148 reads (merged S396); its capture found 345 of 359, so it is extracting with the other curriQunet colleges. **Reconcile, read:** Orange Coast's REQUIREMENTS tab prints "Total Major Units", "OCC AS General Education Up to 21" and "Total Minimum Degree Units - OCC AS GE 60"; Monterey Peninsula's GE page states Cal-GETC as 34, MPC GE by area with no total; Victor Valley's AUTO 82.0 prints no units; its totals agree without it. **Wave 4 (S396-S398), done.** Nine colleges loaded unchecked (curriQunet unless named): Ventura and Oxnard (CourseLeaf) 101 and 64, Reedley 36, Palomar 220, Chabot 231, Allan Hancock 153, Santa Ana 346 (347 of 359 found, $22.03), Rio Hondo 288 (292 of 301, $18.94), Saddleback 311 (321 of 353, $25.88); Orange Coast's and Monterey Peninsula's reconciles and rereads. Build `66b50c86891e` (7,125 rows) applied by run 38909267523 (S398) after S397's run 38857449086 was canceled at the display job's then 30-minute limit with 6,875 written and no applied record (those rows go back by re-applying `515c9d71e086`'s receipt to its keys, null for the rest); build `fa8ee2a84935` (8,070 rows, #2158) applied from `main` in S398. **The display job now has 120 minutes and new receipts are gzipped** (#2159): at 0.22 s a program the apply of 8,070 runs about 30 minutes, and a plain receipt (about 9 KB a program, 72.7 MB at 8,070) would have passed GitHub's 100 MB file limit near 11,000 programs; `zcat` reads a `.sql.gz` receipt, and earlier builds keep their plain `.sql`. Procedure records (S398): Allan Hancock, Chabot and Palomar v1; Ventura, Oxnard and Reedley v2 merged onto S346's record (`kb/_program_source_procedure_v1.py --merge`); Santa Ana, Rio Hondo and Saddleback follow `fa8ee2a84935`'s apply. **Open from the reads:** Palomar lost 103 of 331 programs' pages to a sibling award; Ventura and Oxnard each keep 30 records out of the load (no listed course placed); Saddleback 19 and Santa Ana 8 pages claimed by a sibling. **NEXT:** procedure records for the three, then the next wave from the census's unread catalogs.

🔨 **The Records view loads by college (S384; Sam, 2026-10-13, `cpl_memory` `sam-records-load-by-college-filter-2026-10-13`).** The cap, the anon timeout and #2088-#2089: lessons, *Moved from the lane (S385 compaction)*. #2090: a light index for every college (about 0.6 MB), full records only for the colleges the filters reach (S390, #2121, Sam 2026-10-14: District, College, SWP Region and CIP Sector dropdowns; the tab opens on Progress and carries no Sierra window), and every attention link (deep link, call cards, Next waiting, the Progress counts) loading its record on demand with nothing picked. **NEXT:** read the CIP filter's first live batches (`coci_college_programs`, 150 a read) in `edge_logs`.

Sheet 77 card 3 (the college's items on one line, #2093, #2097): lessons, *Moved from the lane (S387 compaction)*.

✅ **Flags and a person's reading are built (S347; Sam, Sheet 51 card 1).** Confirm or Needs a fix writes `program_record_verdicts` through `program_record_verdict_add`; a trigger keeps a person's reading across a reload. Detail: lessons doc, *Moved from the lane (S356 compaction)*.
