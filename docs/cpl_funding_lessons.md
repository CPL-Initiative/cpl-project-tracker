# CPL Implementation Funding tab — lessons

Workstream scratchpad for the **Implementation Funding** dashboard tab
(hash `#implementation-funding`), built 2026-06-11 in a session running
**parallel to an active CCR session** — hence the unusual constraint set:
shell-first, then new-files-only.

## 2026-06-11 — Session 1 (tab shipped)

### What shipped

- **PR #352 (merged)** — the empty tab shell in both HTMLs ONLY: left-rail
  button "Implementation Funding" (after Budget), pane
  `#tab-implementation-funding` with placeholder mount `#cplFundingMount`, and
  an inline boot snippet that lazy-loads `cpl_funding.js` on first activation
  via the existing `CPL_TABS.onActivate`/`loadScript` helpers. `loadScript`
  fails soft, so the shell merged *before the module existed* and showed
  "coming soon" — and every later PR is new-files-only.
- **PR 2** — the tab itself, all new files: committed source workbook
  (`funding/CPL_Funding_Model_2026.xlsx`), one-shot extractor
  (`funding/_build_funding_data.py`), static data artifact
  (`cpl_funding_data.js`, ~54 KB — NOT a daily-cron artifact, same lifecycle
  as `college_short_names.js`), renderer (`cpl_funding.js`: pool cards,
  priority cards, formula explainer, searchable/sortable per-college table
  with the SYSTEM row pinned as a tfoot total), and
  `tests/cpl_funding.test.js` (33 assertions).

### The funding model (decoded + machine-verified)

The workbook is one sheet, two blocks. The extractor re-derives every college
row and asserts it matches the workbook to <1¢ (`max drift 0.01`):

- **Pool**: $9,040,307 (2025-26 remaining one-time) + $35,000,000 (2026-27
  one-time) − $1,200,000 (admin, 2 FTE × 3 yrs) − $8,040,307 (scaling
  projects & tech) = **$34.8M college funding, 3 annual tranches of $11.6M**
  (2026-27 → 2028-29).
- **Per-student rate** = $11.6M ÷ 2,190,740 statewide headcount = **$5.295**.
- **Three priorities**, each `allocation = headcount × rate × factor ×
  $5.295`: P1 completion (rate 5%, factor 6 → 30% share), P2 access (6%, 7 →
  42%), P3 capacity (4.667%, 6 → 28%). Shares sum to exactly 1, so a
  college's total potential allocation **is its headcount share of one
  $11.6M tranche**. SYSTEM row = the statewide totals; average allocation
  $98,682.78/yr across 118 college rows.

### Workbook quirks (handle on the next edition)

- The third year column is **labelled "26-27" again — a source typo for
  28-29**; the pool math (3 × 11.6M = 34.8M) pins the window. Extractor
  documents + corrects.
- The "26-30 TOTAL AVAILABLE COLLEGE FUNDING" value cell is empty (merged
  cell); extractor computes it and asserts the arithmetic.
- `COLLEGE HEADCOUNT PCT CPUNTY TOTAL` (sic) is **internally inconsistent**
  (some rows = pct of county, some duplicate the statewide pct). Extracted
  as `headcount_county_pct` but NOT rendered — don't surface it without
  upstream cleanup.
- 4 colleges carry `*Survey did not estimate counties <65K in population` →
  `working_adults: null`; renderer shows em-dashes (test-guarded against
  NaN).

### PII check (per the standing-PII-guard methodology)

Workbook is **clean**: institutional + U.S. Census aggregates only (college/
district/county names, headcounts in the thousands, dollars). No
person-level columns; nothing to suppress. `tests/pii_guard.test.js` has a
**fixed EMAIL_FILES list** that predates this artifact, so
`tests/cpl_funding.test.js` carries its own mirror scan (email allow-list +
person-level-key regex) over `cpl_funding_data.js`. **Follow-up:** fold
`cpl_funding_data.js` into pii_guard's EMAIL_FILES (1 line) once the
parallel-session shared-file freeze lifts.

### Patterns that worked

- **Shell-first + fail-soft lazy boot** is the right shape for adding a tab
  while another session is active: one tiny HTML PR, then zero shared-file
  contention. The shell survived a full local `excel_to_dashboard.py` regen
  (verified before PR 1 — the §6b bounded-regex catastrophe is the thing to
  check, not assume).
- **Verify the model in the extractor, not the UI**: the builder asserts
  priority shares sum to 1 and re-derives all 3×118 allocations from the
  formula, so a future workbook whose constants drift fails the build
  instead of rendering wrong dollars.
- Scoped CSS injected from JS (CER pattern), `var(--token)` only —
  test-enforced (`no raw hex` assertion).

### Open follow-ups (smallest first)

1. ~~pii_guard EMAIL_FILES fold-in~~ — **DONE PR 3 (2026-06-11)**.
2. ~~Shared-doc rows~~ — **DONE PR 3**: CLAUDE.md §7b tab-table row + §2
   file-inventory rows + `docs/INDEX.md` lessons-table row.
3. `data-sections` sidebar TOC on the pane (the "Sidebar levels" backlog) —
   needs a shell-HTML touch or a JS `setAttribute` before first activation.
4. New workbook editions: drop at `funding/CPL_Funding_Model_2026.xlsx`,
   re-run `python3 funding/_build_funding_data.py`, commit both. If the
   model ever becomes curator-editable, follow the Excel→Supabase Phase 2-4
   five-step shape (seed → read-path → editor → RLS) instead of growing the
   workbook.

### 2026-06-11 (later) — freeze lift: CCR-session coordination + shared-file follow-ups

Sam asked to coordinate with the parallel CCR session and move forward.
**Coordination = repo-state check, since sessions can't message each other:**
zero open PRs repo-wide, `main`'s tip was this workstream's #353, and the 17
`claude/*` remote branches are all pre-auto-delete leftovers of merged PRs —
nothing in flight, so the shared-file freeze lifted. Edits were kept to
single disjoint rows/lines so even a CCR push mid-flight rebases cleanly.
Shipped (PR 3): pii_guard EMAIL_FILES + scope-comment line, CLAUDE.md §7b +
§2 rows, INDEX.md row, these doc updates. **Deliberately skipped: the
Dashboard teaser card** — the generator hardcodes teasers for only 3 of 12
tabs (Workplan Goals / Budget / Vision 2030; none of the newer tabs have
one), so a funding teaser isn't the established pattern AND it's the
highest-collision file (the generator is where `export_unified_courses`
lives). Available on request as a small generator edit at the
`teaser_html` block (~line 10076).
