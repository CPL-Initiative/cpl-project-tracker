# Credential Rename Dry-Run — 2026-11-01

Generated: `2026-11-01T05:20:59Z`

**Mode B preview** — projects `unified_title_override` curator entries from `kb/credential_review_overlay.json` onto the post-rename state of the three credential-identity files (`unified_titles.json`, `credentials.json`, `coci_articulations.json`). Reports collisions + downstream impact. **Does NOT apply.** Apply is Cred-Ref PR-5b/1, manual workflow_dispatch.

## Apply gates

| Gate | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | No two renames target the same new name | PASS ✓ |
| V2 | Every source unified_title exists somewhere | PASS ✓ |
| V3 | No CLEAN rename target collides with an existing credentials.json key | PASS ✓ |
| — | Queued collisions (non-blocking — wait for a curator decision) | 1 |
| **Apply safe** | V1–V3 pass + at least one clean rename or confirmed merge (queued collisions don't block) | **YES — PR-5b/1 can dispatch** |

## Confirmed merges (would FOLD on apply — PR-5b/2)

| Old unified_title | ⇒ folds into | Records folding | Already on target | raw_titles | articulations |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `Spanish 1` | ⇒ `Elementary Spanish I` | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| `Spanish 2` | ⇒ `Elementary Spanish II` | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |

## Clean renames (would land on apply)

_None today._ Infrastructure populates the moment a curator enters a rename.

## Collisions (queued, non-blocking — curator decision required)

Each row's proposed new title already exists as a key in `credentials.json`. Policy: non-blocking decision queue — these wait (clean renames + confirmed merges apply without them) until the curator picks a non-colliding target or explicitly confirms the merge in the CER triage lane (PR-5b/2).

| Old | → | New (collides) | Existing records on target | Why queued |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `Wheel Alignment, Chassis Dynamics, and ADAS` | → | `Wheel Alignment, Chassis Dynamics, ADAS` | 2 | collision_with_existing_credential |

## Skipped

_None._
